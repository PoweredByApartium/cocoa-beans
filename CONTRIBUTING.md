## 👥 Contributing to Apartium Cocoa Beans
To keep it simple, there are just a few simple 📜 rules for contributing:
1. 👨‍💻 Each class, method and package must have a clear and useful documentation
2. 🧪 Modules not dependent on Spigot most have as close to a 100% unit test coverage
3. 🔬 Each unrelated change most have its own PR
