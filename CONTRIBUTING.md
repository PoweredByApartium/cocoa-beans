## Contributing to Apartium Cocoa Beans
To keep it simple, there are just a few simple rules for contributing:
1. Each class, method and package must have a clear and useful documentation
2. Modules not dependent on Spigot most have as close to a 100% unit test coverage
3. Each unrelated change most have its own PR
