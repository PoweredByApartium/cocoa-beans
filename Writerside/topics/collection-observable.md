# ðŸ§° Collection Observable

## Introduction
A Collection Observable is an observable that wraps around a collection (like a list or set) and tracks changes to its contents, 
not just its reference

## ðŸ§  Why is it special?
Most observables only react when their **value changes**â€”for example,
when you assign a new list.
But what if you just add or remove an item from the existing list?
That's where `CollectionObservable` shines:
- It knows when **items are added, removed, or reordered.**
- Even if the reference stays the same, it can still detect **internal changes.**

## ðŸ“¦ What does it do?
- Lets you observe **dynamic collections**.
- Automatically updates anything watching itâ€”like UI elements, counters, or filtered viewsâ€”when the collection changes.
- Works seamlessly with tools like `MappedObservable` or filters/sorts.

## ðŸŒŠ Use Case Examples
- A list of players in a game lobby that updates when players join or leave.
- A cart in a shopping app that reacts when items are added or removed.
- A filtered view that always shows only the matching items.
