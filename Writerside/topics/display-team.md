# üë• DisplayTeam

## Introduction

The `DisplayTeam` api is a packet-level NMS-driven team display controller designed for Minecraft. It integrates seamlessly with UI systems by leveraging Observable state objects to ensure efficient updates across player clients.

Unlike typical Bukkit or API-level teams, `DisplayTeam` is optimized for direct manipulation via packets, making it extremely responsive and suitable for custom teams, overlays, or nametag modifications in real time.
While giving you more free control over who see your teams

## Usage

Here is an example of using the API with Spigot. You will have to implement a custom Team manager to manage active teams and their references.
**Beware** that you will need to create your own manager and decide how to manage teams
I will keep it simple here is simple manager

<code-block lang="java" src="scoreboard-spigot/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="TeamManager"/>

Here is how we create prefixes in tab and above head

<code-block lang="java" src="scoreboard-spigot/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="Rank"/>

<code-block lang="java" src="scoreboard-spigot/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="createRankTeams"/>

<sub>We also need to add the players as viewers and parts of the team</sub>

<code-block lang="java" src="scoreboard-spigot/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="onJoin"/>


## Sorting Tab-list

In Minecraft, the **tab list** <sub>(player list)</sub> can be sorted using teams, where the team name determines the sort priority.

### üîç How Tab List Sorting Works

Minecraft sorts players in the tab list based on their **team name in lexicographical (alphabetical) order**. Players on teams with names that come earlier in the alphabet will appear higher in the list.

To control priority using numbers, you can **prefix team names with numbers**, such as `"0001_team"`, `"0002_team"`, etc. Lower numbers = higher priority in the tab list.

### Code snippet

<code-block lang="java" src="scoreboard-spigot/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="formatTeamName"/>

### Notes
For **LuckPerms** we would like to invert the number because their priority go up
for example `MAX_PRIORITY - priority`, where max priority has to be higher than or equal to the highest configured priority in the system
