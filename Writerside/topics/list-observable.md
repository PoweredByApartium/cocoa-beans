## Introduction
A **List Observable** is a specialized `CollectionObservable` that focuses on **ordered collections**â€”specifically,
lists. Unlike sets, lists have a **defined order**, which means changes like reordering, inserting, or removing elements at specific indices matter.

## Usage
<code-block lang="java" src="common/CodeSnippets.java" include-symbol="simpleList"/>
