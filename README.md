## Welcome to Cocoa beans!
This library aims to be a very well-made and thought-out toolkit for developers to save the hassle
of copying common code between projects. Cocoa beans is modular, it contains a spigot module 
and a common java module and commands java module and commands spigot module inside of it, with more modules planned for the future.\
**Contributions are welcome!**
